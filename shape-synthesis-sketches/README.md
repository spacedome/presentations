# Shape Synthesis from Sketches via ProceduralModels and Convolutional Networks

A presentation of the work by Haibin Huang, Evangelos Kalogerakis, Ersin Yumer, and Radomir Mech (2017).

Using an AlexNet based CNN model to learn a mapping of human sketches to procedural model parameters for generating 2D/3D shapes. 

See [Huang's webpage]( http://people.cs.umass.edu/~hbhuang/publications/srpm/index.html) for more information, as well as the paper itself.
